### Settings Explanation

#### Enable Free Shipping Progress Bar
If set to yes, a free shipping progress bar will be shown on the shopping cart in the cart summary. By default, the free shipping progress bar is disabled.

#### Use Free Shipping Method Configuration
If set to yes, this module will use the configuration for the core Free Shipping method. If that method is enabled then this Free Shipping Progress Bar will show based on that method's minimum order subtotal. If set to no, you will be able to set a custom order subtotal for this Free Shipping Progress Bar to show based on. This setting is primarily useful if your store is using a free shipping method other than the core Free Shipping method. By default, this setting is set to yes.

#### Free Shipping Progress Bar Minimum Order Total
When the above setting is set to no, this field is where you set the order value that the Free Shipping Progress Bar counts down to.

## Compatibility
This module has been tested and validated to work on Magento versions 2.3 to 2.4.2.
